Heavy Metal Alchemist
===
What happens when alchemy meets heavy metal? You get Heavy Metal Alchemist—a crafting game that cranks the volume up to 11 and adds a devilish twist!

You play as Alec, a double-kick drum-loving bard with a passion for music and mayhem. Sick of the boring, conventional methods of alchemy, Alec decides to revolutionize potion-making by channeling the unholy power of metal and a little help from… down below. With your shredding skills and a summoning pentagram at your disposal, you’re ready to craft creations the world has never seen.

Will you rise to become the ultimate Heavy Metal Alchemist?

## Gameplay
The alchemical magic starts here:
1. Discover recipes: Drag items into the summoning circle and experiment to unlock new combinations.
2. Invoke rituals: Channel the fiery energy of hell to summon raw elements.
3. Master the rhythm (WIP): Complete a rhythm-based mini-game to craft your masterpiece.
4. Repeat and dominate: Experiment, refine, and rock your way to ultimate power.
